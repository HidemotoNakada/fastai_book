### 無償利用できるGoogleのGPUノートブック

This is a quick guide to starting Practical Deep Learning for Coders using Google Colab. 
Colab is a service that provides GPU-powered Notebooks for free. 
It's based on, but slightly different to, regular Jupyter Notebooks, 
so be sure to read the Colab docs to learn how it works.

NB: Colab is a free service that may not always be available, 
and requires extra steps to ensure your work is saved. 
Be sure to read the docs on the Colab web-site to ensure you understand the limitations of the system

## Opening a chapter of the book

You can open any chapter of the book in Colab by clicking on one of these links: Introduction to Jupyter | Chapter 1, Intro | Chapter 2, Production | Chapter 3, Ethics | Chapter 4, MNIST Basics | Chapter 5, Pet Breeds | Chapter 6, Multi-Category | Chapter 7, Sizing and TTA | Chapter 8, Collab | Chapter 9, Tabular | Chapter 10, NLP | Chapter 11, Mid-Level API | Chapter 12, NLP Deep-Dive | Chapter 13, Convolutions | Chapter 14, Resnet | Chapter 15, Arch Details | Chapter 16, Optimizers and Callbacks | Chapter 17, Foundations | Chapter 18, GradCAM | Chapter 19, Learner | Chapter 20, conclusion

Alternatively, head on to the Colab Welcome Page and click on 'Github'. In the 'Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user' line enter 'fastai/fastbook'. You will see all the courses notebooks listed there. Click on the one you are interested in using.

NB: One section of chapter 2 uses Voila, which unfortunately is not supported by Colab. For that section, either skip it, or use a different platform such as Gradient (Colab is the only platform which doesn't support Voila).
